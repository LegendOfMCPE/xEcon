[15:23] <@PEMapModder> For xEcon
[15:24] <@PEMapModder> I totally forgot what I had done :P
[15:24] <@PEMapModder> I think what we need is
[15:24] <+Tuff> Wow
[15:24] <@PEMapModder> Some convenient commandw
[15:24] <@PEMapModder> The infrastructure iw done
[15:24] <+Tuff> hmmm
[15:24] <@PEMapModder> But we need the facilities like commands and byproducts like shops
[15:24] <+Tuff> like the old economy plugin?
[15:25] <@PEMapModder> Yes 
[15:25] <@PEMapModder> I am trying to make it like thar
[15:25] <@PEMapModder> except
[15:25] <@PEMapModder> Use /x setmoney instead of /setmoney
[15:25] <+Tuff> hmm, okay
[15:26] <+Tuff> I like your max money feature
[15:26] <+Tuff> so people can't get 9999999999999
[15:26] <@PEMapModder> Hmm
[15:26] <@PEMapModder> They can buy external saves if they have too much money
[15:26] <@PEMapModder> I am thinking about an optional feature of money clear on death
[15:27] <+Tuff> Ooooh
[15:27] <@PEMapModder> I mean cash clear
[15:27] <@PEMapModder> But bank is safe
[15:27] <+Tuff> that would be rather devastating for the player
[15:27] <+Tuff> mmm to encourage banking
[15:27] <@PEMapModder> Yes
[15:27] <@PEMapModder> But if we somehow increase the trouble of banking
[15:28] <@PEMapModder> Then it will get interesting
[15:28] <@PEMapModder> A creative server can even enable robbing banks
[15:28] <+Tuff> ha, frustrating more like it
[15:28] <+Tuff> ooooh
[15:28] <@PEMapModder> But I don't know how we do it to help :D
[15:28] <+Tuff> that sounds FUN
[15:28] <+Tuff> kill the teller
[15:28] <@PEMapModder> I don't know how we can help servers doing this
[15:29] <@PEMapModder> And who is the teller? Mr. BotBot?
[15:29] <+Tuff> it wouldn't CD
[15:29] <+Tuff> No the bank teller
[15:29] <@PEMapModder> {o^o}
[15:29] <+Tuff> risk
[15:29] <+Tuff> idk
[15:29] <+Tuff> I do like that idea
[15:29] <@PEMapModder> The name of the MCPE bot: {o^o} xD
[15:29] <@PEMapModder> Just joking
[15:29] <+Tuff> :P
[15:29] <@PEMapModder> For the bot thing
[15:30] <+Tuff> ya
[15:30] <@PEMapModder> I was thinking that
[15:30] <@PEMapModder> Maybe we can make something like "services" to make it more systematic
[15:30] <@PEMapModder> That is
[15:31] <+Tuff> don't want to make it too complicated, were working with 13 year olds
[15:31] <+Tuff> we're
[15:31] <@PEMapModder> When you buy something from the server, your money is passed to the account called "server" instead of the money disappearing
[15:31] <@PEMapModder> Owners and players don't have to know that
[15:31] <@PEMapModder> It is just how we log things
[15:31] <@PEMapModder> Later if we add transaction logs
[15:32] <@PEMapModder> We can make it such that the server itself is an economic entity
[15:32] <+Tuff> Wow
[15:32] <+Tuff> cookbook
[15:32] <+Tuff> lmao
[15:32] <+Tuff> autocorrect
[15:32] <+Tuff> coooool
[15:32] <+Tuff> the server could offer jobs
[15:33] <+Tuff> for pay
[15:33] <@PEMapModder> and all transactions with the server (shops, sell centers, etc.) are logged as a man who sells these things
[15:33] <@PEMapModder> Brb
[15:33] <+Tuff> Ok
[15:34] <+Tuff> 3:34 AM where I live
[15:36] <+Tuff> I'm going to think on IRC now
[15:36] <+Tuff> we need a good way to bring money spent on the server
[15:37] <@PEMapModder> I'm reading
[15:37] <+Tuff> back to the spender, to create circulation
[15:37] <+Tuff> hmmmm
[15:37] <+Tuff> No fun without circulation
[15:37] <@PEMapModder> My hands are busy but my eyes aren't 
[15:37] <+Tuff> ha, okay, that's fine
[15:38] <+Tuff> players could create their own businesses???
[15:38] <+Tuff> but the money in the server wouldn't move
[15:38] <@PEMapModder> Yes that's why we made economic entities
[15:38] <@PEMapModder> A player organization/clan/whatever can be an econ entity too
[15:38] <+Tuff> it would still sit
[15:38] <+Tuff> minigames perhaps?
[15:39] <@PEMapModder> ?
[15:39] <+Tuff> oooh that makes things interesting
[15:39] <+Tuff> I was thinking players would be paid for monogrammed
[15:39] <+Tuff> lmao
[15:40] <+Tuff> minigames
[15:40] <@PEMapModder> Faction is an examp of player organization.
[15:40] <+Tuff> that's awesome
[15:40] <+Tuff> faction shops
[15:41] <+Tuff> hmmm
[15:41] <+Tuff> this is getting more complex the more I think about it
[15:41] <@PEMapModder> Good idea
[15:41] <@PEMapModder> The trouble is
[15:41] <@PEMapModder> How to set money for non player entities
[15:42] <@PEMapModder> Well
[15:42] <+Tuff> non players receive payment???
[15:42] <@PEMapModder> For minecraft entities, we'll call them PmEntity for clear meaning ok?
[15:42] <+Tuff> Ok
[15:42] <@PEMapModder> Yes, like factions get faction money
[15:43] <@PEMapModder> Can you copy down this discussion?
[15:43] <+Tuff> uuuh sure
[15:43] <@PEMapModder> Thanks
[15:43] <+Tuff> copy paste
[15:43] <+Tuff> so pigs are entities, they receive $$$
[15:44] <+Tuff> ?
[15:44] <+Tuff> k 'm
[15:44] <+Tuff> nvm
[15:45] <@PEMapModder> Entities mean things/organizations/whatever that can receive, save and pay money
[15:45] <@PEMapModder> PmEntitirs mean minecraft things that can move without coords as integers.
[15:45] <+Tuff> the players need to have jobs
[15:46] <+Tuff> got it
[15:46] <@PEMapModder> Yes
[15:46] <@PEMapModder> Then we can make the Server be the payer of the job
[15:46] <+Tuff> and not just tree cutter
[15:46] <+Tuff> ya
[15:46] <@PEMapModder> Ya
[15:46] <+Tuff> that was my idea
[15:46] <@PEMapModder> We will think further about jobs later on
[15:47] <@PEMapModder> Right now, I need to make sure I know what is done and what isn't 
[15:47] <+Tuff> that's what players ALWAYS ask
[15:47] <@PEMapModder> What kinds of jobs possible except block breaking and placing?
[15:47] <+Tuff> "how do I get money"
[15:47] <+Tuff> I'll sit on it.
[15:48] <+Tuff> what is not done?
[15:48] <+Tuff> cmds?
[15:49] <+Tuff> Lol this conversation is so scrambled
[15:50] <+Tuff> Well jobs that would be helpful would be preferred
[15:50] <+Tuff> like a server police
[15:50] <@PEMapModder> Back
[15:50] <+Tuff> or farmer
[15:50] <+Tuff> hello
[15:51] <@PEMapModder> How do you get yo know whether the player had done that thing
[15:51] <@PEMapModder> That is the problem.
[15:51] <+Tuff> farmer, easy
[15:51] <+Tuff> police, not so much
[15:51] <@PEMapModder> What does a police have to do?
[15:51] <+Tuff> cuss words, spawn killing
[15:51] <+Tuff> the like
[15:52] <@PEMapModder> Police have to spawn kill?
[15:52] <+Tuff> no, they jail spawn killers
[15:52] <@PEMapModder> An idea is item renting
[15:52] <+Tuff> ohoho
[15:52] <+Tuff> me gusta
[15:53] <@PEMapModder> But the damage value is the trouble source
[15:53] <+Tuff> pay for damage
[15:53] <+Tuff> I like that idea
[15:54] <+Tuff> player pays for time and damage done to the item
[15:54] <@PEMapModder> Oh yeah
[15:54] <@PEMapModder> Apart from the server paying for jovs
[15:54] <@PEMapModder> *jobs
[15:54] <+Tuff> us
[15:54] <+Tuff> ya
[15:54] <@PEMapModder> Players can also earn money for working for other players or their factions
[15:55] <@PEMapModder> BTW for PocketFactions
[15:55] <+Tuff> yes?
[15:55] <@PEMapModder> The trouble is how to send a message to a faction
[15:55] <+Tuff> huh?
[15:56] <+Tuff> sounds easy
[15:56] <@PEMapModder> How?
[15:56] <@PEMapModder> For example, economic entities must implement the send message function
[15:56] <+Tuff> loop through each member of the faction and send them a message
[15:57] <@PEMapModder> Faction implements Requestable and \xecon\entity\Entity
[15:57] <@PEMapModder> But some messages are critical messages while some
[15:57] <@PEMapModder> While some are not
[15:57] <+Tuff> u made ur own Entity class
[15:57] <@PEMapModder> Yes
[15:58] <@PEMapModder> So?
[15:58] <+Tuff> nothing...
[15:58] <@PEMapModder> Also
[15:58] <+Tuff> :P
[15:58] <@PEMapModder> Entity is a trait not a class
[15:58] <+Tuff> ah
[15:58] <@PEMapModder> I changed that in May.
[15:58] <+Tuff> Oh yeah
[15:59] <+Tuff> critical messages
[15:59] <+Tuff> can have a critical message tag
[15:59] <+Tuff> Lol
[15:59] <@PEMapModder> sometimes only faction staffs can know it
[15:59] <@PEMapModder> Sometimes everyone should know it
[16:00] <+Tuff> sometimes the people who are wearing iron armor need to know it
[16:00] <+Tuff> CD
[16:00] <@PEMapModder> But it is unreasonable for the interfaces/abstract classes/traits to ask subclasses to implement the $level parameter 
[16:00] <+Tuff> XD
[16:00] <@PEMapModder> XD
[16:00] <@PEMapModder> The problem is, the Faction doesn't know the level.
[16:01] <+Tuff> true
[16:01] <+Tuff> mind = boggled
[16:01] <@PEMapModder> The signature for the classes is public function sendMessage($msg);
[16:01] <+Tuff> ya
[16:02] <@PEMapModder> Brb
[16:02] <+Tuff> I think I'm just gonna start committing stuff that comes to my mind
[16:02] <+Tuff> Just to mess with u
[16:02] <+Tuff> Lol jk
